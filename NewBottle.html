    <h1>New Bottle, Same Juice</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>There was once a juice company that announced the launch of a new product. The packaging was different—new boxes and bottles—and the excitement was real. But when people tasted it, they realized it was the exact same juice as before. The only thing that had changed was the outside.</p>

    <p>Sadly, this is how many people today experience spiritual change. They change their outward appearance—they attend church, speak differently, or even get baptized—but their hearts remain the same. It's like that same juice, just in a new bottle.</p>

    <h2>The Call to True Transformation</h2>
    <p>When God called Abraham, it wasn’t just about leaving a place—it was about a complete change of life and direction. God said:</p>
    <blockquote>“Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you.” – Genesis 12:1</blockquote>

    <p>Following God requires leaving behind not just old habits, but also old environments and old friendships that don’t lead you closer to Him. Just like Abraham, we are called to step out in faith and let God lead us.</p>

    <h2>Repentance Is More Than Words</h2>
    <p>Real repentance is not just feeling sorry for your sins—it is making the decision to turn away from them. It's a heart change, not just an external one. Peter said:</p>
    <blockquote>“Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins...” – Acts 2:38</blockquote>

    <h2>Do You Feel Stuck?</h2>
    <p>Maybe you’ve tried to change before, and failed. Maybe you’re tired of fake change. The truth is, only God can truly transform a life. Don’t just change your “packaging”—let God renew you from the inside out.</p>

    <p>Make time to seek Him in prayer. Let His Word guide you. Surround yourself with those who build your faith. The journey may not be easy, but real freedom and joy are found in surrendering to God.</p>

    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Have I changed only on the outside, or has God really changed my heart?</p>
