  <div class="container">
    <p>This is a topic that stirs a lot of debate. Some churches set specific rules about how their members should dress, even going as far as giving guidelines on hairstyles suitable for church. Others argue that a person’s appearance has nothing to do with their relationship with God.</p>
    <p>I am not here to judge or condemn anyone. However, as someone who desires to live a life that is pleasing to God, I encourage you to always ask yourself this simple question before you dress, style your hair, or choose a new outfit: <strong>“Does this outfit make me look different from those who don’t honor God?”</strong></p>
    <p>Some may say, “Why should I be told how to dress? It’s my body, my choice.” But the better question to ask is: <strong>“Does what I’m wearing bring glory to God, or is it just to attract attention?”</strong></p>
  
 <h2>More Than Style—It's a Message</h2>
    <p>If your clothing reveals too much of your body—especially for sisters in Christ—ask yourself honestly: <strong>What message am I sending? What is the intention behind this style?</strong></p>
    <p>Are you dressing in a way that may stir lust in those who see you? Could it be leading others, especially men, into temptation?</p>
    <blockquote>
      “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.” — <em>Matthew 18:6</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You see, it’s not just those who fall into sin who will be judged, but also those who <strong>lead others</strong> into it.</p>
  
    <h2>And to You Brother</h2>
    <p>Before you choose that outfit, that haircut or hairstyle, consider this: <strong>Does your appearance reflect a man who fears God?</strong></p>
    <p>Are you living to please people or to represent Christ?</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Whoever denies me before others, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.” — <em>Matthew 10:33</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Everything we do—including how we look—should point people to God, not away from Him.</p>
  
    <h2>True Surrender Brings Clarity</h2>
    <p>You can’t understand spiritual truth by your own reasoning or by following the crowd. But when you surrender to God and allow His Spirit to guide you, He will begin to reveal the deeper meaning behind how you live and how you present yourself to the world.</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Be filled with the Spirit, and you will find peace.” — <em>Paraphrase from Ephesians 5:18</em>
    </blockquote>
  
    <h2>Final Encouragement</h2>
    <p>Thank you for walking with us through this teaching series. I invite you to continue the journey with us in the next series as we go deeper into what it truly means to live a life fully surrendered to God.</p>
    <p>Continue praying daily, reading God’s Word, and interceding for the work of God—so that many may repent, including those who think they have repented but haven’t yet truly understood the power of transformation in Christ.</p>
